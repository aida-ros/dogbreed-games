## What this project is about
This was a group assignment in week 4 of Codaisseur. It is a React/Redux project for a simple but fun quiz about dog breeds. 

## Technologies used
- React
- Redux
- Redux-thunk

## Goals for this project:
- To practice developing in a group
- To work with git and GitHub in a group
- To implement an app with React and Redux

## Requirements: 
Build a dog breed memorization game. You'll be using a free public API called Dog API. The webapp must be built using React and Redux.

## Features: 
- Game 1 shows the user a random picture of a dog (using the API), and it must ask the user to choose the correct breed name from a list of 3 options.
- Game 2 shows the user must select the correct image that matches the breed name.
- Game 3 is a combination of game 1 and game 2, where the user randomly gets a question type of game 1 or game 2.
- When a user makes the correct choice, they proceed to the next question.
- If the user makes the wrong choice, the game should show them the right answer, then pause for 2 seconds before proceeding to the next question.
- The game keeps track of the user's performance and displays the success rate (in percentages) on the page.
- The user is also able to use the keyboard to select their answer for quicker gameplay.
- The game starts off with only 3 breeds and should gradually increase in difficulty. When the user has a streak of 5 correct answers, the game will add another 3 breeds into the mix.

-------------------------------------------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
